# Welcome

Thank you for visiting. Please enjoy looking around. I hope you find something you love.

All of the art you will find here is original. Each oil painting is one-of-a-kind. I have a selection of canvas art but specialize in painting on wild turkey feathers.

I take custom orders. I will paint something you want, like a pet, scenery, deer or wildlife picture, etc. Just send me a good picture and Iâ€™ll see if I can do something with it. Please come back often as I will be adding new turkey feather paintings and other works of art on a regular basis.
